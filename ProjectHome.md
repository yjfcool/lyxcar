Modular car PC frontend with built-in navigation.

## Dependencies ##
To build this program you will need some libraries installed in your system.

  * requires [Phonon](http://phonon.kde.org/) (a part of KDE or Qt4)
  * requires [Qt](http://www.qtsoftware.com/) >= 4.3.0
  * requires TagLib
  * requires SQLite3 and support for sqlite datafiles in Qt.

It's easier to build it in Unix system. Under Windows the Visual Studio is needed to build Qt with Phonon support. **MingW GCC doesn't support DirectShow and DirectX at all.**

## Web access, built-in browser ##

To use built-in browser you'll need to compile Qt with [WebKit](http://www.webkit.org/) support.

# Obtaining #

To obtain full source code you'll need an SVN client. There is no packed snapshots yet. And I don't know when they'll be available for download. The version we have in repository now is just testing version for intended people.

Thank you.
